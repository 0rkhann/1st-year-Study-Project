# 1st-year-Study-Project
A cs related research-oriented project

The main idea behind this project was to create something innovative, that would beneficial. So, me with my team came up with idea of creating a monopoly based game with a
theme of my university. This projected was implemented only via Python and its libraries, such that: pygame, easygui, sys, os. So an aim of the project was to show, that 
a process of preparing for exams can be fascinating, playing with your groupmates and answering an upcoming exam related questions. Only limitation of this project, that the resolution of an application is 1500x950 px, so
resolution of the screen should be higher than these parameters. As a result our team got the highest grade along all team. Also take into consideration, that this code was written by the Chemical Engineering(CE) students :)

To launch a game, download a file named "UFAZpoly" and just double click to exe file and then enjoy playing ;)

To see python code, open the py file (the py file contains a lot of lines of code, because I manually wrote into the code the question related to subjects)
