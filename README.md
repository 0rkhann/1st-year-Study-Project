# 1st-year-Study-Project
A cs related research-oriented project

The main idea behind this project was to create something innovative and what would beneficial. So, me with my team came up with idea of creating a monopoly game with a
theme of my university. This projected was implemented only via Python and its libraries, such that: pygame, easygui, sys, os. So an aim of the project was to show, that 
a process of preapring for exams can be fascinating, playing with your groupmates. Only limitation of this project, that the resolution of an application is 1500x950 px, so
resolution of the screen should be higher than these parameters. Also take into consideration, that this code was written by the Chemical Engineering(CE) students :)
